    2.Engage Core Muscles:Focus on contracting your abdominal muscles
    throughout the movement.

    3.Breathing:Exhale as you lift your legs and inhale as you lower
    them back down.

    4.Controlled Movements:Perform leg raises with controlled and
    deliberate movements, avoiding rapid or jerky motions.

    - Leg raises are effective for strengthening the muscles of
    the lower abdomen, particularly the rectus abdominis.
